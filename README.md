"Habits Calendar" will be a React Native app that allows the user to visualize the scheduling and completion of habits. The app will let the user define the time schedule they wish to keep for a habit (e.g. daily, every Tuesday, etc.) and then visualize their progress of developing the habit in a calendar view. A todo list will also be auto-populated from the user's habits. The app will also feature a "mood calendar" that allows the user to visualize and make notes about their mood.
